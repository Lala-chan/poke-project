            <h1 class="plot-title">The Origins of the Pok√©mon World</h1>
            <p class="plot-text">
                Long ago, before cities rose and routes were mapped, the world was wild, a vast land where mystical creatures known as Pok√©mon roamed freely. These beings, each with unique abilities and personalities, lived in balance with nature. Some could breathe fire, others summon lightning, or even bend time and space.
                From this ancient harmony, a new bond was born: between humans and Pok√©mon. People began training these creatures not to control them, but to fight alongside them, to grow, evolve, and form unbreakable friendships.
                The journey truly began in Kanto, where a young Trainer named Red received his first partner, a small fire Pok√©mon, Charmander. With nothing but a dream and a Pok√©ball, he set off to conquer the Pok√©mon League, challenge the fearsome Elite Four, and stand up to the sinister plans of Team Rocket, an organization bent on exploiting Pok√©mon for power.
                As Red‚Äôs journey unfolded, he encountered ancient mysteries: haunted towers, legendary birds, and whispers of a mythical creature named Mew. Deep in a lab, scientists used Mew‚Äôs DNA to create a new being... Mewtwo. But they had gone too far: Mewtwo was powerful, intelligent... and angry.
                The world of Pok√©mon is one of battles and bonds, rivalries and legends. But more than that, it is a world where courage, friendship, and heart always lead the way. And now, it‚Äôs your turn, young Trainer...
                Your journey begins. ‚ö°

                        Ash Ketchum is a bold and energetic Pok√©mon Trainer from Pallet Town with one big dream: to become the world‚Äôs greatest Pok√©mon Master!
                        He may not be the most organized (he overslept the day he got Pikachu...), but he makes up for it with heart, bravery, and a headstrong spirit that never quits.
                        Ash is known for rushing into battle, helping strangers, and forming deep bonds with both Pok√©mon and people ‚Äî especially those grumpy Pok√©mon that nobody else can handle!
                        Though he doesn‚Äôt always win, he never gives up, because for Ash, every battle is a step forward.

                        <i>"Don‚Äôt call me short! I‚Äôm just fun-sized!"</i><br>
                        Misty is the Cerulean City Gym Leader and a fierce Water-type Pok√©mon specialist. Don‚Äôt be fooled by her age, Misty‚Äôs got a fiery temper, a sharp tongue, and a soft spot for cute Pok√©mon (especially Togepi!).
                        She joins Ash on his journey, originally just to get her broken bike back but ends up becoming one of his closest friends and travel companions.
                        While she often scolds Ash for his recklessness, she‚Äôs incredibly brave, loyal, and always ready to dive into danger (or a lake) if her friends need her.
                        Misty believes in battling with strategy, heart, and style.. and she‚Äôs not afraid to put someone in their place if they underestimate her.

                        Brock is the Pewter City Gym Leader and a master of Rock-type Pok√©mon. Calm, wise, and surprisingly domestic, Brock is the ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù of the group; always cooking meals, giving advice, and patching up both Pok√©mon and Trainers alike.
                        He dreams of becoming a world-class Pok√©mon Breeder and knows everything from Pok√©mon nutrition to herbal remedies.
                        But for all his wisdom, there‚Äôs one thing he can‚Äôt control: his hopeless crushes. Whether it‚Äôs a Nurse Joy or an Officer Jenny, Brock falls in love faster than Ash throws a Pok√©ball, and gets dragged away just as quickly.
                        Reliable, nurturing, and brave in battle, Brock is the glue that keeps the team together.

                        <i>"There‚Äôs a time and place for everything ‚Äî but not now!"</i><br>
                        Professor Oak is the leading Pok√©mon researcher in the Kanto region and the very first person most Trainers meet on their journey. He‚Äôs the wise old mentor who hands out starter Pok√©mon, Pok√©dexes, and the occasional cryptic advice, often followed by awkward pauses and dad jokes.
                        Despite his forgetful nature (he can‚Äôt even remember his own grandson‚Äôs name sometimes...), Oak is a brilliant scientist who laid the foundation for modern Pok√©mon studies. He believes deeply in the bond between Trainers and Pok√©mon, and encourages young Trainers to explore, discover, and build their own stories.
                        Oh, and if you thought being a professor kept him out of trouble‚Ä¶ you‚Äôve clearly never seen him ride a Dodrio.

                        <i>"Smell ya later!"</i><br>
                        Gary Oak is Ash‚Äôs childhood rival and the grandson of Professor Oak.
                        Confident, cocky, and always one step ahead (or so he claims), Gary starts his journey as the cool kid with all the badges, all the fans, and none of Ash‚Äôs humble beginnings.
                        Early on, he sees Pok√©mon as a means to prove he‚Äôs the best, but over time, Gary matures into a serious, dedicated researcher.
                        Beneath the arrogance lies real talent and a genuine desire to surpass his limits, even if it means occasionally giving Ash a well-deserved compliment (very occasionally).
                        He may not always win, but when Gary shows up, he makes sure you know it.

                        <i>"Prepare for trouble ‚Äî and make it double!"</i><br>
                        Team Rocket is the world‚Äôs most dramatic villain trio made up of the dazzling Jessie, the flamboyant James, and their wisecracking, talking Pok√©mon companion, Meowth.
                        They work for the evil organization Team Rocket, led by the elusive Giovanni‚Ä¶ though it‚Äôs safe to say this trio doesn‚Äôt exactly strike fear into the hearts of Trainers.
                        Their mission? To steal rare and powerful Pok√©mon, especially Ash‚Äôs Pikachu.
                        Their strategy? Over-the-top disguises, elaborate machines, and spectacular failures usually ending in an explosive "blasting off again!"
                        Despite being the ‚Äúbad guys,‚Äù Team Rocket shows surprising loyalty to each other and even moments of tenderness (especially toward their Pok√©mon).
                        They're not just villains, they‚Äôre misunderstood dreamers‚Ä¶ with amazing hair.
